      "I started my internship @ Alundi, here it was my task to help upgrade the mobile Ionic app to the latest version by using Capacitor instead of Cordova plugins. I also had to help out on the .NET backend, here I had to write an email engine so that we could send invoices for our clients. In this internship I did my Bachlor's thesis about online signatures. It took a lot of research to find the juridical and technical aspects of online signatures. As my PoC I had to write a small mobile app that could sign a document and send it to the client. It was an assingment that was given to me by the company, but I really enjoyed researching the juridical and technical aspects of the online signatures.",

      "The first line of code, I started writing code in 2015. I loved playing GTA V Roleplay on the FiveM platform. That is why i started developing my own server by using pre-made scripts and altering them to fit to my needs. Usually it was HTML, CSS and a small bit of JavaScript that needed to be changed but later on I also started writing LUA code.",

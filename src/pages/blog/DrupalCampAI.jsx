				It felt like a whirlwind, witnessing the emergence of
				'Artificial Intelligence' narratives seemingly out of nowhere,
				yet undeniably pervasive. Amidst the awe-inspiring capabilities
				of OpenAI's model, questions arose â€“ not just about what Large
				Language Models achieve, but also about our collective rush
				towards them, the timing of their release, and how we can
				ethically harness such advancements. Ben Caudron delved into
				these inquiries in his keynote, titled 'The Genesis of
				Generative Grace'. He contextualized today's 'Generative AI'
				within the broader political economy of AI, advocating for a
				critical analysis of the narratives shaping the future of the
				field. Central to his framework are notions of data commons and
				algorithm transparency, though definitive answers remain
				elusive, leaving us with pressing questions. Having played a
				role in shaping the digital transformation of enterprises,
				Caudron draws from his past experiences, notably chronicled in
				his 2012 Dutch-language book, "Not Fun?". Today, as a technology
				sociologist and Head of Program at Erasmus University for
				Applied Sciences (EhB), he continues to dissect the origins,
				underlying ideologies, and ramifications of Big Tech's power.
				His forthcoming collection of essays concludes with thoughtful
				reflections on potential alternative trajectories, revealing an
				underlying optimism.

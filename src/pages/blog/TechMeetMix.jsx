        At our recent Tech Meet & Mix event, attendees were treated to a
        tech-filled day featuring in-depth sessions on Flutter by Fré Dumazy and
        RedwoodJS by Adam Juran. Fré’s exploration of Flutter emphasized its
        cross-platform capabilities, showcasing practical applications through
        hands-on demonstrations. Juran, on the other hand, shed light on
        RedwoodJS, highlighting its many purposes and tight integration with
        GraphQL.
